Imani Escrow is an innovative e-commerce platform designed to protect both buyers and sellers through a seamless escrow mechanism. Built using Next.js, Solidity, and the Ethers.js library, our platform allows users to browse, buy, and sell products while ensuring a secure transaction experience.

## Overview

In today's digital marketplace, trust is essential. Imani Escrow bridges the gap between buyers and sellers, ensuring that every transaction is safeguarded. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **User Dashboards:** Both buyers and sellers have access to their personal dashboards, where they can track orders and manage product listings.
